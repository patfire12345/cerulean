Through the event, Cerulean was able to deliver meaningful values and bring volunteer work closer to the community as well as the children, thus connecting souls that share the same idea, creating a memorable day. \n \n Moreover, Cerulean and REVERIE have succeeded in providing the Shelter’s young artists a chance to learn more about themselves in which, eventually, we could all see and admire the artistic beauty of France through their little innocent and purely adorable strokes. As a result, we shall be able to take a break from the amount of stress and pressure that life has to offer while also being able to better listen and understand our inner selves more deeply. ",
